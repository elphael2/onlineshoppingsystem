Hi, This is the Online Shopping System Project

How to use and install:

1. Download the project (obviously)
2. Install XAMPP(for the ease of hosting)
3. Remember in the installer, install most of the services(mainly MySQL, Apache and PHPmyadmin)
4. Go to the directory of XAMPP
5. After installing, place the entire project folder into ..\xampp\htdocs (It should look like "..xampp\htdocs\onlineshop") (Downloading from GitHub may result in different file name of the project folde, its recommended to change it to just "onlineshop")
6. Open XAMPP in Administrator mode to prevent system errors.
7. Before accessing the website, host both MySQL and Apache services on XAMPP.
8. Then go to The phpmyadmin server you hosted
9. Create a database first, it should be named: 'onlineshop' for importing the database
10. Click on the import option. Select onlineshop.sql.gz (from the database folder)and import it
11. Now go to The hosted website and you are all set!
